# PCB Design in Git

- We will be using git to store KiCad files as well so that we can have a running record of them.
- Put all the PCBs in a subfolder in the PCB repo.
- Make a branch for your board, and only work on that board on the corresponding branch.
- Donâ€™t delete your branch once you merge it; keep making changes on that branch.
- Only one person should work on a board at a time, and all changes should be committed before the next person works on it.
